## Back to Beginnings  

Prior to this course, I have only had very surface level understanding of Javascript and did not really dive into the intricacies of the language. In truth, I had originally learned the basics of programming in Javascript
in small exercises like creating simple games to learn how to create functions and the overall flow of coding along with creating simple web pages with HTML and CSS. However, that was years ago and I have not touched the 
language since. Coming into this course I knew that Javascript was involved, and I was kind of interested to see the language I learned programming in with more experienced eyes. I did have some concern when we were 
assigned to complete the 111 Javascript exercises and the 29 ES6 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, due to just the sheer number of exercises. However, working through the course it became significantly easier and more 
interesting as the lessons became progressively more in depth and less similar to the other programming languages I know like C and Python. Overall, I think it was a good introduction to the power that Javascript has and 
some of the optimizations that ES6 provides.

## A Familiar Feeling

Javascript as a language to me is very interesting as it is pretty simple to pick up as a learning tool, but has a lot of complexity behind it. The process for learning the language itself for me was very similar to other 
languages I had learned in my previous computer engineering classes such as Java, C, C++, and Python. In particular, it was very similar to my experience with Python especially in the way that it is not a strongly typed 
language meaning that variables could be of any type, be it a string or an integer. When learning both languages this feature threw me off a bit because of the time I spent learning almost exclusively strongly typed 
languages. I can see the power and convenience behind this feature, but I find it kind of dangerous to not know what the data type is when a variable or function is declared and how it can lead to errors or confusion. 
This means it is up to the programmer to truly understand what is going on when using these languages. The hardest part about exercises for me was learning the idiosyncrasies and syntax for functions, especially function 
destructuring which is something that I had never been exposed to before. However, I do think it is one of the most interesting features that we learned about in the introduction and I hope I will be able to implement 
this technique more as I get more comfortable with the language.

## Exercising A Muscle

I think the concept of athletic software engineering is a very good way to practice the problem solving skills and critical thinking required to solve coding problems. At the time of writing this, I have not experienced 
an actual in class WOD, but from my experience with the practice WODs it seems that the problems are pretty fair with the amount of time given and were pretty straightforward. Personally, I think that the process of being 
under pressure and having to apply the knowledge that we recently were exposed to is a good way to remember and actually learn the material. The consistent practice helps exercise our critical thinking and problem solving 
skills and allows us to code and debug more efficiently. Moreover, I think that the added stress and challenge to make the best time you can is pretty satisfying.
