A UI (User Interface) framework serves as a toolbox for developers, equipped with pre-built code libraries, components, and tools.

By offering standardized methods for UI design and implementation, these frameworks streamline the development process and ensure a cohesive look and feel across various sections of an application or even different applications.
Within these UI frameworks, there is an assortment of components such as buttons, forms, navigation menus, sliders, and other interactive elements which also they often have pre-designed layouts, themes, and stylesheets.
