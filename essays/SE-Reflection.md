# Semester Recap
This semester marked my introduction to software engineering, a departure from my previous coursework focused on circuitry, hardware, and algorithms, among other topics. Prior to enrolling in ICS 314, I had only had surface level experience in product development and its underlying processes. However, completing this course has been very insightful, as it introduced me to various relevant practical concepts and tools.
# Software Engineering is a Team Sport
Among the multitude of valuable skills gained, I find collaborative programming through git and Coding Standards particularly noteworthy. Before taking this course, I only really used Github and git as a means to transfer and manage my coding projects. Throughout the course, we primarily utilized GitHub as our version control system, which allowed for adept web development with multiple developers. It is particularly useful in terms of its version control features and collaboration tools. It facilitates seamless collaboration among developers through features like pull requests, branching, issue tracking, and project board. These tools streamline communication and enhance teamwork, ensuring smoother development workflows.
# Coding Standards
When considering Coding Standards, which are vital for maintaining code consistency and organization, I initially had reservations about ESLint, our main linting tool. While I disagreed with some of ESLint's enforce formatting conventions, such as the positioning of 'else' statements and specific spacing rules, I acknowledge its value in improving code readability and structure. Especially in collaborative projects, ESLint proved invaluable in ensuring a consistent coding style across the team, ultimately streamlining the development process.
# Wrap Up
In retrospect, I found the breadth of topics covered in ICS 314 to be fairly interesting, with a plus of providing a solid foundation in practical skills. The exposure to a diverse array of concepts will be useful in my future coursework and professional development.
