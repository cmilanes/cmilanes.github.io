For AP computer science in high school, one of the final project we were tasked with designing was a text-based RPG to apply what we learned about object oriented programming into a project. The project involved the creation of various parent and child classes for the different types of characters that the player of the game could select. This went hand in hand with creating mutators and accessors for the various classes and using them to program how they would interact in the main gameplay loop. In addition to the player classes, the ability to create and read save data was a feature for the game. This was done using some simple file I/O methods in Java in order read a file, parse the data, and use the data in the game.
