The UH Mānoa Smart Campus Energy Lab (SCEL), as part of the Vertically Integrated Project (VIP), is currently focused on developing weatherboxes. These hardware units consist of various sensors enclosed in weatherproof casings, capturing meteorological data such as solar radiance, temperature, and humidity. The collected data is then utilized to train a machine learning model for weather pattern forecasting, optimizing the placement of photovoltaic panels across the campus. This technological advancement aligns with UH Mānoa's goal of achieving 100% sustainability. On a broader scale, the entire state of Hawaii aims for 100% renewable energy by 2045, and this innovative approach contributes to maximizing cost-efficient renewable energy efficiency.

For this project, I was a memeber of the firmware team who was responsible for programming and maintaining the hardware code and database of the weatherboxes developed by the hardware teams. In the fall 2023 semester, the firmware team was tasked with researching new sensors, developing a weatherbox testbench, and creating a dataset vending machine. This tasks featured the use of C, C++, and Python, along with integration with Arduinos.
